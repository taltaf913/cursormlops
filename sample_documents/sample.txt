# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the correct answers are provided. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on these examples.

Examples include:
- Classification: Categorizing emails as spam or not spam
- Regression: Predicting house prices based on features

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, finding hidden patterns and structures without predefined outputs.

Examples include:
- Clustering: Grouping customers by purchasing behavior
- Dimensionality reduction: Reducing the number of features in a dataset

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Examples include:
- Game playing: Teaching computers to play chess or Go
- Robotics: Training robots to navigate environments

## Key Concepts

### Features and Labels
- Features: The input variables used to make predictions
- Labels: The output variables we want to predict

### Training and Testing
- Training set: Data used to teach the model
- Test set: Data used to evaluate model performance

### Overfitting and Underfitting
- Overfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Underfitting: Model fails to capture the underlying pattern in the data

## Popular Algorithms

### Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
